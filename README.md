# crit_learn_delay

This repository contains the code, data, and writing for the
paper:

**Criterial Learning and Feedback Delay: Insights from
Computational Models and Behavioral Experiments**

**Authors:**  
Matthew J. Crossley
Benjamin O. Pelzer
F. Gregory Ashby

## Directory Structure

- **data/**  
  Contains the raw data from the experiments.

- **output/**  
  This is the directory where the output from the parameter
  space partitioning analysis is written. These files can be
  too large for GitHub, so they are not included in the repository.

- **code/**  
  Contains the code for the computational models and for
  analyzing the behavioral data.

## How to Run

- To analyze the behavioral data, run:  
  `inspect_results_behave.py`

- To analyze the computational model results, run:  
  `inspect_results_model.py`
