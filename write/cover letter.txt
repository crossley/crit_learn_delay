Dear colleague, 

Our submitted manuscript, "Criterial Learning Depends on Procedural Mechanisms", shows that even the most basic task grounded in declarative memory may rely on associative mechanisms.  This finding requires us to reevaluate current conceptions of the boundaries between purported procedural versus declarative tasks.  Thus, we hope researchers from many subfields will enjoy our paper, including category learning, reinforcement learning, general memory systems, and decision making.  

Thank for considering our paper for publicaiton in memory & cognition.  

Sincerely,

Matthew J. Crossley, PhD
