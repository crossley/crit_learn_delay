\section{Introduction}
The notion of a response criterion is ubiquitous in
psychology. It is a key component of almost all decision
models. For example, the hypothesis that even YES-NO
detection decisions are determined by comparing the sensory
magnitude to a response criterion that is under the
observer's control, rather than to a fixed absolute
threshold, allowed signal detection theory to supplant
classical threshold theory as the dominant model in
psychophysics \parencite{GreenSwets1966}. All models that
include a response criterion assume its value is learned and
can shift if changes are made to instructions or payoffs. So
criterial learning is a fundamental component of almost all
decision-making models. Despite its importance, however, the
cognitive and neural mechanisms that underlie criterial
learning remain poorly understood.

This article addresses this shortcoming through a
combination of computational modeling and empirical data
collection. Specifically, we develop and test three
different computational models that make qualitatively
different assumptions about how the criterion is learned.
The models differ in the role they assign to working memory
and in whether they treat the response criterion as a
fundamental psychological construct, or instead assume that
behavior is driven purely by stimulus-response associations
without any criterion guiding responses. These models are
then tested in two behavioral experiments. The modeling and
empirical focus are on how feedback delays and the length of
the intertrial interval (ITI) affect criterial learning. All
criterial-learning models assume that updating (i.e.,
learning) of the criterion occurs during the time interval
between feedback presentation and the stimulus presentation
that defines the onset of the next trial. So feedback delay
and the length of the ITI are the independent variables that
most clearly differentiate the conflicting predictions of
criterial-learning models. Furthermore, feedback delays are
known to impair some forms of learning (i.e., procedural)
much more than others (i.e., learning that relies on
declarative memory), so feedback-delay manipulations offer a
powerful method of disambiguating the nature of criterial
learning \parencite{ell2009critrial, MaddoxAshbyBohil2003,
MaddoxIng2005}.

Although the models could be tested in any task that depends
on criterial learning, the two experiments we describe used
a one-dimensional category-learning task. In such tasks,
stimuli vary across trials on two or more dimensions -- one
relevant to categorization and one or more that are
irrelevant. The observer's goal is to identify the relevant
dimension and learn the response criterion that maximizes
accuracy. This task has been used in hundreds of studies,
and all current models of performance in this task emphasize
the role of criterial learning.

In the first behavioral experiment, participants were
explicitly instructed about the relevant dimension, thereby
isolating criterial learning from rule selection and
switching processes. The results showed that short feedback
delays impaired learning compared to immediate feedback.
The second behavioural experiment used stimuli composed of
binary features -- where no criterial learning is needed --
and did not instruct participants about the relevant
dimension. Thus, this experiment isolated rule selection and
switching from criterial learning. The results found that
increasing feedback delay or ITI did not affect performance.
These findings suggest that feedback delays impact criterial
learning but not the discovery of the relevant stimulus
dimension.  More broadly, they indicate that criterial
learning may recruit procedural learning, even in tasks that
seem to rely on explicit, rule-based processes.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \section{Experiment 1: The Models}

\DIFdel{We developed three computational models , each representing
different architectures }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section{New Computational Models of Criterial Learning}
\DIFadd{We developed computational models }\DIFaddend of criterial learning
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{within two broad architectures }\DIFaddend and examined their
sensitivity to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the duration of ITIs }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{ITI duration }\DIFaddend and feedback delay. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Two of the models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The
architectures differ in whether they }\DIFaddend assume that the
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{criterion is }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{response criterion is explicitly represented in memory. In
the first architecture, the criterion is }\DIFaddend stored in memory\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{and that response decisions are made }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{,
and responses are generated }\DIFaddend by comparing the current \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{stimulus-driven percept
to }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{percept
with }\DIFaddend this stored referent. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Both of these models further posit that the internal
representation of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The }\DIFaddend criterion is updated \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{following }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{after
}\DIFaddend errors using a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{simple }\DIFdelend gradient-descent rule. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The third model
assumes that no }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Models in this class
can exhibit sensitivity to ITI and feedback delay in three
distinct ways: (1) perceptual drift, where stimulus
representations change over time, (2) criterial drift, where
the stored criterion shifts over time, and (3)
delay-sensitive updating, where the magnitude of criterion
updates decreases with longer feedback delays. In the second
architecture, no explicit }\DIFaddend criterion is stored\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{nor used to generate
responses}\DIFdelend .  Instead,
reinforcement learning \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is used to form
stimulus-response associations and these associations drive responding without any appeal to the notion of a criterion }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{forms direct stimulus--response
associations that drive performance.  Sensitivity to ITI and
feedback delay arises from either perceptual drift or
delay-sensitive updating, but criterial drift is not
possible since no criterion is represented}\DIFaddend .

For each of \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the three }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{these }\DIFaddend models, denote the time of stimulus
presentation on the current trial by T$_\text{S}$, the
response time by T$_\text{R}$, the time when feedback is
displayed by T$_\text{F}$, and the time when the stimulus
that begins the next trial is displayed by T$_{\text{S}^+}$.
Then note that the feedback delay equals $\text{t}_\text{FD}
= \text{T}_\text{F} - \text{T}_\text{R}$ and the duration of
the ITI equals $\text{t}_\text{ITI} = \text{T}_{\text{S}^+}
- \text{T}_\text{F}$.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Time-Dependent Drift Model}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The time-dependent drift model assumes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{Models that assume a stored criterion}
\DIFadd{These models assume }\DIFaddend that the observer constructs a \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{criterion, holds this value }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{response
criterion, maintains it }\DIFaddend in working memory, and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{then makes
response }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{makes
}\DIFaddend decisions by comparing the percept to \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the criterion. The model also assumes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{this criterion. They
may further posit }\DIFaddend that both the \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{memory representation of the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stored }\DIFaddend criterion and the
perceived \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{value of the stimulus gradually }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{stimulus value }\DIFaddend drift over time\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{. The model
further assumes that }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, with }\DIFaddend the extent of
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{this drift increases with
time, }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{drift increasing }\DIFaddend both within a trial and \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{between }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{across }\DIFaddend consecutive
trials. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In addition, they may assume that the learning rate
for updating the criterion decreases as the feedback delay
increases.
}\DIFaddend 

Let $x_n(t)$ and $c_n(t)$ denote the values of the percept
and the criterion, respectively, on trial $n$ at time $t$.
Then the decision rule on trial $n$ is:
\begin{equation}
  \text{Respond } R_n =
  \begin{cases}
    \text{A}, & \text{if ~} x_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) \leq c_n(\text{T}_\text{S})  \\
    \text{B}, & \text{if ~} x_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) > c_n(\text{T}_\text{S}).
  \end{cases}
  \label{eq:DR}
\end{equation}
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Note that this equation indicates that the response is made
immediately upon stimulus presentation. We therefore are not
explicitly modelling the time-extended cognitive processes
that govern evidence accumulation and the corresponding
response time.
}

\DIFaddend If positive feedback is received, then the value of the
criterion remains unchanged for the next trial (except for
drift -- see Equation \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3).  }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{eq:criterion}).  The rationale
here is that if the response is correct, then the observer
has effectively gained zero information about how their
criterion should be modified.  }\DIFaddend If negative feedback is
received, then the criterion is modified according to the
standard model
\parencite{SuttonBarto1998}:
\begin{equation}
c_n(\text{T}_\text{F}+ \Delta_t) = c_n(\text{T}_\text{F}) + \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\alpha }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\frac{\alpha}{t_{FD}} }\DIFaddend [x_n(\text{T}_\text{F}) - c_n(\text{T}_\text{F})],
\label{RL}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ is a learning-rate parameter, and $\Delta_t$
is the time it takes to complete the updating.  It is
straightforward to show that the iterative Equation \ref{RL}
is equivalent to computing a weighted mean (weighted by
recency) of the values of all percepts that occur on error
trials \parencite[e.g.,][]{Ashby2017}. This updating rule
will gradually converge on the optimal criterion value
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{.
Since this model assumes }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{(i.e., the true criterion value the observer is trying to
learn).  
}

\DIFadd{The term $\frac{\alpha}{t_{FD}}$ captures the notion that
the magnitude of the update decreases as the feedback delay
increases.  As a result, when feedback is delayed, the
system becomes less responsive to errors, leading to slower
learning compared to immediate feedback conditions. However,
since this model is consistent with the idea }\DIFaddend that criterial
learning relies on working memory -- and the available
evidence suggests that logical reasoning and working memory
are unaffected by feedback delays of several seconds
\parencite[e.g., in one-dimensional rule-based category
learning tasks;][]{ell2009critrial, MaddoxAshbyBohil2003,
MaddoxIng2005} -- \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{we assume that }\DIFdelend the learning process described in Equation
\ref{RL} \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is likewise }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{likewise be }\DIFaddend unaffected by feedback delay. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{In this
case, the term $\frac{\alpha}{t_{FD}}$ is replaced by
$\alpha$, making the learning rate independent of feedback
delay.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Although the criterial-learning process described by
Equation \ref{RL} is not affected by
feedback delay, we
assume }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This model further assumes }\DIFaddend that both the stimulus and the
criterion representations \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may }\DIFaddend drift randomly throughout the
duration of time they are maintained in working memory. The
representation of the criterion must always be maintained in
working memory, whereas drift in the stimulus representation
affects performance up until the feedback is presented, but
not afterwards. \DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdelend We modeled the drift in both the criterion
and the percept by adding white noise to their initial
values. Specifically, we assumed that for all
$t>\text{T}_\text{S}$
\begin{equation}
  c_n(t) = c_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) + \eta_c \epsilon(t),
  \label{eq:criterion}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
  x_n(t) = x_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) + \eta_x \epsilon(t),
  \label{eq:percept}
\end{equation}
where $\epsilon(t)$ is white noise and $\eta_c$ and $\eta_x$
are parameters that determine the amount of drift over time.
\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Note that these parameters are permitted to be equal to zero
which is equivalent to assuming that the criterion and/or
the percept do not drift over time at all.
}

\DIFaddend This model predicts that at the time of feedback, the
response criterion $c_n(\text{T}_\text{F})$ will be normally
distributed with mean $c_n(\text{T}_\text{S})$ and variance
$\text{t}_\text{FD} \eta_c^2$. Similarly, at the time when
the stimulus that defines the next trial is presented, the
criterion $c_n(\text{T}_{\text{S}^+}) =
c_{n+1}(\text{T}_\text{S})$ is normally distributed with
mean $c_n(\text{T}_\text{S})$ and variance
$(\text{t}_\text{FD}+\text{t}_\text{ITI}) \eta_c^2$. The
predictions for the percept are similar. Specifically, at
the time when feedback is presented, the percept
$x_n(\text{T}_\text{F})$ is normally distributed with mean
$x_n(\text{T}_\text{S})$ and variance
$(\text{T}_\text{F}-\text{T}_\text{S}) \eta_x^2$.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Delay-Sensitive Learning Model}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Like the time-dependent drift model, the delay-sensitive
learning model assumes that decisions are based on comparing
the current stimulus to a stored referent. However, unlike
the time-dependent drift model, the criterion remains stable
over time and does not drift. For this reason, the memory
system used to store the criterion may be different from
working memory. In other words, $c_n(t)=c_n$ for all
$t>\text{T}_\text{S}$. This model also assumes that the
magnitude of error-driven updates to the criterion decreases
in proportion to the length of the feedback delay.  As a
result, when feedback is delayed, the system becomes less
responsive to errors, leading to slower learning compared to
immediate feedback conditions. 
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{This model also assumes that the percept does not drift over
time. Instead, it models perceptual noise as a
time-invariant perturbation. Specifically, the
delay-sensitive learning model assumes the observer uses the
following decision rule:
}\begin{displaymath}
  \DIFdel{\text{Respond } R_n =
  \begin{cases}
    \text{A}, & \text{if ~} x_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) + \epsilon_p \leq c_n  \\

  \end{cases}
  %DIFDELCMD < \label{eq:DR}%%%
}\end{displaymath}%DIFAUXCMD
\DIFdel{where the time-invariant perceptual noise term $\epsilon_p$
is normally distributed with mean 0 and variances
$\sigma_p^2$. This same value of perceptual noise corrupts
all future values of the percept. Therefore, $x_n(t) =
x_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) + \epsilon_p$ for all $t >
\text{T}_\text{S}$.
}%DIFDELCMD < 

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{The delay-sensitive learning model assumes that longer
feedback delays slow criteral learning. Specifically, the
model assumes that if negative feedback is received, the

%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{This model }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{These models
}\DIFaddend assumes that the perceptual representation of each stimulus
is defined by the pattern of activation across 25 sensory
units that are characterized by overlapping tuning curves.
Each unit is maximally excited by one specific stimulus,
which we call the unit's preferred stimulus. Specifically,
the activation of the $i^\text{th}$ sensory unit on trial
$n$ is given by
\begin{equation}
  A_i(n) = \text{exp} \left( \frac{-\left[d_{i,S_n}\right]^2}{\sigma^2} \right)
  \DIFaddbegin \label{eq:DSL_activation}
\DIFaddend \end{equation}
where $d_{i,S_n}$ is the (Euclidean) distance between the preferred
stimulus value of the $i^\text{th}$ sensory unit and the
value of the stimulus that was presented on trial $n$, and
$\sigma$ is a constant that increases with perceptual noise.

The model includes two decision or actor units -- one
associated with each of the two possible responses.
Initially, each sensory unit is connected to both actor
units with some random connection strength. Let
$\omega_{iJ}(n)$ denote the strength of the connection
between sensory unit $i$ and actor unit $J$ (for $J$ = A or
B) on trial $n$. Then the activation in actor unit $J$ on
trial $n$, denoted by $V_J(n)$, equals
\begin{equation}
  V_J(n) = \sum_{i} \omega_{iJ}(n) A_i(n)
\end{equation}
Responses are generated by the decision rule:
\begin{equation}
 \text{Respond } R_n =
  \begin{cases}
    A, & \text{if $V_A(n) > V_B(n)$}\\
    B, & \text{if $V_A(n) \leq V_B(n).$}
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}
The connection strengths $\omega_{iA}(n)$ and
$\omega_{iB}(n)$ are updated after feedback is received on
each trial according to standard reinforcement learning
rules \parencite{SuttonBarto1998}:
\begin{equation}
  \omega_{iA}(n) = \omega_{iA}(n-1) + \frac{\alpha_{actor}}{t_\text{FD}} \delta(n-1)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \omega_{iB}(n) = \omega_{iB}(n-1) + \frac{\alpha_{actor}}{t_\text{FD}} \delta(n-1),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{actor}$ is the learning-rate of the actor, and
$\delta(n-1)$ is the reward prediction error on trial $n-1$.
Note that as in \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the delay-sensitive learning model}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Equation~\ref{RL}}\DIFaddend , the learning rate is
scaled by the inverse of the feedback delay. 
\DIFaddbegin 

\DIFaddend Much evidence suggests that this type of stimulus-response
learning is mediated largely within the striatum, and is
facilitated by a dopamine (DA) mediated reinforcement
learning signal that is time dependent
\parencite[e.g.,][]{ValentinMaddoxAshby2014}. Specifically,
the dopamine signal generated by positive feedback appears
to peak at around 500 ms after feedback and then decay back
to baseline levels within 2 or 3 s
\parencite{YagishitaEtAl2014}. As a result, synaptic
plasticity at cortical-striatal synapses is attenuated with
increasing feedback delays \parencite{YagishitaEtAl2014}.
The scaling of $\alpha_{actor}$ by \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$1/t_\text{FD}$ models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{${1}{t_\text{FD}}$ is one
way to model }\DIFaddend this phenomenon. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{However, it is possible that
criterial learning via stimulus-response associations is
mediated by other brain systems that are less sensitive to
feedback delay. In this case, the learning rate would be
independent of feedback delay, and the term
$\frac{\alpha_{actor}}{t_\text{FD}}$ would be replaced by
$\alpha_{actor}$.
}\DIFaddend 

The reward prediction error on trial $n-1$ is defined as the
value of the obtained reward, denoted by $R(n-1)$ minus the
value of the predicted reward, denoted by $P(n-1)$:
\begin{equation}
  \delta(n-1) = R(n-1) - P(n-1).
\end{equation}
The predicted reward on trial $n$ is determined by the
critic via
\begin{equation}
  P(n\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{+1}\DIFdelend ) = P(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{n}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{n-1}\DIFaddend ) + \frac{\alpha_{critic}}{t_\text{FD}} \delta(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{n}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{n-1}\DIFaddend ),
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_{critic}$ is the learning rate of the critic.
This learning rate \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{is again }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{may again be }\DIFaddend scaled by the inverse of the
feedback delay. \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{If sensitivity to feedback delay is not
assumed in Equation~\ref{RL}, then the term
$\frac{\alpha_{critic}}{t_\text{FD}}$ is replaced by
$\alpha_{critic}$.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Because this class of models does not store an explicit
response criterion, it cannot incorporate criterial drift.
It can, however, incorporate perceptual drift. In this case,
the value of the current stimulus used to compute sensory
unit activation (Equation~\ref{eq:DSL_activation}) is
assumed to drift over time according to
}\begin{equation}
  \DIFadd{S_n(t) = S_n(\text{T}_\text{S}) + \eta_S \epsilon(t),

\DIFadd{where $\eta_c$ scales the magnitude of the drift and

\DIFaddend \subsection{Simulation Results}
We investigated how changing the duration of the feedback
delay and ITI affect criterial learning for each \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{of these
three models}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{class of
model}\DIFaddend . More specifically, we simulated performance of
each model in a categorization task that included two
categories of stimuli that varied on a single stimulus
dimension and that could be categorized perfectly by
comparing each stimulus to an appropriate value of the
response criterion (We used the same experimental design as
in Experiment 1, so see those methods for more details). Our
simulations included three experimental conditions: Delayed
Feedback, Long ITI, and Control. The Delayed-Feedback
condition included a long feedback delay (3.5 s) and a short
ITI (0.5 s). The Long-ITI condition matched the total trial
duration of the Delayed-Feedback condition but with a short
feedback delay (0.5 s) and a long ITI (3.5 s). The Control
condition included both a short feedback delay (0.5 s) and a
short ITI (0.5 s). Each simulation continued for 200 trials
or until the model responded correctly for 12 trials in a
row. For each set of parameter values, we simulated the
model 100 times and averaged the results, yielding one
observed performance metric measured in trials-to-criterion
for each condition. 
\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{All scores were then normalized by the
largest observed value, and as a result, all axes in the
figures that describe the simulation results range from zero
to one.
}\DIFdelend 

Our approach was to generate predictions for each of the
three experimental conditions across a wide range of
parameter values. We then used parameter-space partitioning
(PSP) to evaluate the performance of each model
\parencite[PSP;][]{pitt2006global}.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{PSP }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{Classical PSP is
defined for non-stochastic models and is often implemented
by exploring the parameter space via MCMC.  In contrast, we
used brute force search over a grid of plausible parameter
values. Because our models are stochastic, at each sampled
parameter setting we generated multiple simulations and
classified the expected qualitative pattern.  PSP }\DIFaddend calculates
the proportion of the parameter space where a model makes
specific qualitative predictions. We focused on four such
predictions. The first was that learning under feedback
delay would be slower than in the other two conditions. The
second was that learning in the Long ITI condition would be
slower than in the other two. The third was that learning in
the control condition would be slower than in either of the
other two conditions. The fourth was a catch-all category
encompassing any other possible patterns of results. For
each model, the PSP analysis quantified the proportions of
the explored parameter space where the model made these
qualitative predictions.

interval because reinforcement-learning models are prone to
instability at very high learning rates
\parencite{SuttonBarto1998}. As evidence of this, at higher
learning rates, the model failed to learn with any
consistency -- that is, in most cases, it failed to reach
the learning criterion (12 correct responses in a row)

\subsubsection{Summary of modeling results}
We \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{investigated three }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{examined two classes of }\DIFaddend criterial-learning models that
make different predictions about \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{how increases in the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{the effects of }\DIFaddend feedback

model predicts }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. The first class assumes }\DIFaddend that the criterion \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{always drifts, so the
critical variable is
the sum of the feedback delay and ITI. How this sum is divided into separate feedback delay and ITI
time intervals has little effect on the model's predictions. In contrast, the delay-sensitive learning model predicts
that feedback delays are necessarily more detrimental to
performance than increases in the ITI.  Finally, the
reinforcement-learning model also predicts that, in general,
feedback delays should impair learning more than long ITIs ,
although this model is somewhat more flexible than the
delay-sensitive learning model and can account for a small
or null effect of feedback delaywithin a restricted region
of its parameter space. The obvious next question is how
human criterial learning is affected by these independent
variables. Experiments 2 and 3 were designed to address this
question, and therefore also to test the predictions of
the
three models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{is
stored in memory and compared against incoming stimuli to
generate responses. These models predict greater impairment
from feedback delay only when the update rule is explicitly
delay-sensitive. Otherwise, they are generally more impaired
by long ITIs than by feedback delay}\DIFaddend . \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{The second class
assumes no stored criterion, with responses driven instead
by reinforcement learning through gradual tuning of
stimulus–response associations. These models almost
uniformly predict greater impairment from feedback delay
than from long ITIs.
}\DIFaddend 

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \section{Experiment 2}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Experiment 2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section{Experiment 1}
\DIFadd{Experiment 1 }\DIFaddend investigated how feedback delay and the length
of the ITI affect criterial learning in humans. As a result,
it also provides rigorous tests of the predictions of the
time-dependent drift model, the delay-sensitive learning
model, and the reinforcement-learning model.

The stimuli in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend were circular sine-wave gratings
that varied across trials in bar width and bar orientation.
These stimuli were divided into two categories according to
their value on one of the two dimensions. In other words,
the optimal strategy was to set a response criterion on the
single relevant dimension, and then choose a categorization
response based on whether the value of the presented stimuli
on this dimension was larger or smaller than the criterion
value. 

The experiment isolated criterial learning by (1) explicitly
instructing participants on the relevant stimulus dimension
and rule structure (e.g., thick bars are ``A'', thin bars
are ``B''), and (2) eliminating variability along the
irrelevant stimulus dimension. In other words, the
instructions identified the relevant stimulus dimension, and
as a result, the only learning required was criterial
learning. 

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Apparatus}
All experiments were performed in a dimly lit room.
Participants sat approximately 24'' from a 17'' $\times$
11'' monitor running at a resolution of 1680 $\times$ 1050
pixels. Participants made category judgments by pressing the
`d' or `k' keys on a standard computer keyboard for `A' or
`B' choices, respectively. Stickers with bold print `A' or
`B' were placed on the appropriate keys.

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Categories}
Stimuli were circular sine-wave gratings that varied in bar
width and bar orientation, drawn from various 1-dimensional
uniform distributions specific to the current category
problem. We first defined an arbitrary 2-dimensional
$[0-100,0-100]$ stimulus space, and then split each
dimension of this space into 7 bins of width 14 units each.
Each $(x,y)$ pair from this arbitrary stimulus space was
converted to a grating according to the nonlinear
transformations defined by
\textcite{treutwein1989perceptual}, which roughly equate the
salience of each dimension (for details, see also
\textcite{CrossleyAshby2015}).

The structure of the various criterial-learning tasks is
illustrated in Figure \ref{fig_design_exp_1_space}. Each
criterial-learning problem was created by first \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{randomly
}\DIFdelend selecting a
relevant dimension\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, and then randomly selecting
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{. This was spatial frequency for the
problems 1 thorugh 7 and orientation for problems 8 through
14. We then randomly selected }\DIFaddend one of the 7 bins defined on
that dimension. Each bin was also associated with a
corresponding unique value on the irrelevant dimension. We
buffered the to-be-learned response criterion by 10\% of
total bin width on either side with a no-stimulus region.
Random uniform samples from the remaining eligible region of
each bin were then selected and presented to the participant
until 9 correct responses out of any 10 responses in a row
advanced the participant to the next problem. Note that
every category problem was a simple one-dimensional rule in
which optimal accuracy was 100\%.  Note also that the
relative location of the optimal response criterion varied
across problems.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
There were three conditions (described in detail in Table
\ref{conditions_exp_1}). In the Delayed-Feedback condition,
feedback was delayed 3.5 s after the response and the ITI
was 0.5 s. In the Long-ITI condition, feedback was delayed
0.5 s after the response and the ITI was 3.5 s. Finally, in
the Control condition, feedback was delayed 0.5 s after the
response and the ITI was 0.5 s.

Each participant completed a series of one-dimensional
category-learning tasks or problems, which are described in
Figure \ref{fig_design_exp_1_space}. Each problem included
stimuli in two distinct clusters that varied over a
restricted range of the relevant dimension. Critically, the
optimal criterion value varied from problem-to-problem with
respect to its position within this range. For example, for
some problems the optimal criterion was below the midpoint
of the range and for other problems it was above the
midpoint. 

Participants were explicitly told the relevant dimension for
each problem, as well as the generic response mapping (e.g.,
thick bars = ``A'', thin bars = ``B''). Figure
\ref{fig:trial} shows the structure of an example trial,
along with an example of a typical category structure. All
trials in every condition included a 500 ms fixation cross,
a response-terminated stimulus, a circular white-noise mask,
corrective feedback, and an inter-trial interval (ITI) that
varied according to condition. The text `Correct' was
displayed in centered, large green font after correct
responses, and the text `Incorrect' was displayed in

Participants practiced each problem until they responded

problem changed. Each participant completed as many problems
as possible in 512 trials or until they had been in the lab
for 60 minutes (including time to acquire consent and give
instructions), at which point the session was terminated.

\subsubsection{Participants}
Fifty-nine participants participated in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1. }\DIFaddend All
were UCSB undergraduates and received course credit for
their participation. All had normal or corrected to normal
vision. We randomly assigned each participant to one of
three conditions (target $N>16$ per condition based on
similar previous research): Delayed Feedback ($N = 20$);
Long ITI ($N = 21$), Control ($ N = 17$). All participants
gave written informed consent before participating in the
study. All experimental protocols were approved by the
University of California at Santa Barbara Human Subjects
Committee in the Office of Research Development and
Administration.

\subsection{Results}
Figure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig_gmm_hist_1} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig_mm_hist_1} }\DIFaddend shows a relative frequency
histogram of the trials-to-criterion observed across all
three conditions. The histogram shows that the majority of
participants were able to learn each problem on average in
less than 100 trials. However, this histogram also shows
that a subset of participants required many more trials to
learn each problem. Given that each problem is very simple
and that the relevant dimension of each problem is
explicitly instructed to participants, it is likely that the
participants in the tails of this distribution did not pay
attention to the instructions, were not motivated to learn
the task, were distracted by other factors, or should be
considered outliers for some other reason.

\DIFdel{Experiment 3 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \section{Experiment 2}
\DIFadd{Experiment 2 }\DIFaddend was designed to reinforce the findings of
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend by using the same design but with stimuli that
have binary-valued dimensions, thereby eliminating criterial
learning. Unlike Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend , we did not explicitly
instruct participants on the relevant stimulus dimension in
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3.  While Experiment 2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2.  While Experiment 1 }\DIFaddend isolated criterial
learning from rule selection and rule switching, this
experiment isolates rule selection and switching from
criterial learning. Therefore, Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend was designed to
test whether the impaired learning that we observed in
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend when the feedback was delayed can be attributed
principally to criterial learning or whether it could be due
to some more general category-learning process.

\subsection{Method}

\subsubsection{Apparatus}
The apparatus was the same as in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1.
}\DIFaddend 

\subsubsection{Stimuli and Categories}
The stimuli consisted of colored geometric figures presented
on a colored background. These varied across six binary
dimensions: the number of items (either one or two), the
size of the items (small or large), the color of the items
(yellow or blue), the shape of the items (circle or square),
the texture of the background (smooth or rough), and the
orientation of the background (horizontal or tilted by 20
degrees). This combination resulted in a total of 64 unique
stimuli ($2^6$). An example trial and stimuli are shown in
Figure \ref{fig_design_exp_2}. In all conditions, the order
of stimulus presentation was fully randomized for each
participant, and the relevant dimension for each problem was
selected randomly without replacement from the set of six
dimensions.

  \label{fig_design_exp_2}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Procedure}
Participants received detailed instructions about the task.
However, unlike in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend , they were not informed of
the relevant dimension or the correct rule. The trial timing
for the Delayed-Feedback and Long-ITI conditions in
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend were the same as in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2. Experiment 3
}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1. Experiment 2
}\DIFaddend did not include a condition that was analogous to the
Control condition of Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1. }\DIFaddend Participants practiced
each problem until they responded correctly on 12
consecutive trials. At this point, the problem changed. Each
participant completed as many problems as possible in 600
trials or until they had been in the lab for 30 minutes
(including time to acquire consent and give instructions),
at which point the session was terminated.

\subsubsection{Participants}
Thirty-four participants participated in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2. }\DIFaddend All
were Macquarie University undergraduates and received course
credit for their participation. All had normal or corrected
to normal vision. We randomly assigned each participant to
one of two conditions: Delayed Feedback ($N = 17$) or Long
ITI ($N = 17$).  All participants gave written informed
consent before participating in the study. All experimental
protocols were approved by the Macquarie University Human
Research Ethics Committee (protocol number: 52020339922086). 

\subsection{Results}
Figure \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{\ref{fig_gmm_hist_2} }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{\ref{fig_mm_hist_2} }\DIFaddend shows a relative frequency
histogram of the trials-to-criterion observed in both
conditions. The histogram shows that the majority of
participants were able to learn each problem on average in
less than 100 trials.  Unlike Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend , there were no
highly suspicious outliers in this data set. Nevertheless,
for symmetry with Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend , we performed the same
Gaussian mixture model analysis as used there. The
two-component model provided a slightly smaller AIC value
(\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{317.40 vs. 317.78), but }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{324.75 vs. 317.18), and }\DIFaddend a slightly larger BIC value (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{325.03
vs. 320.83}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{329.33
vs. 327.87}\DIFaddend ). The \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{bootstrap }\DIFaddend likelihood-ratio test was not
significant (\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{$\chi^2(3) = 6.38$, $p = .09$}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{$D = 11.41, p_{\text{boot}} \approx 0.2277$}\DIFaddend ).
We therefore did not exclude any participants from further
analysis in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2.

\DIFdelbegin %DIFDELCMD < \subsection{Discussion of Experiments 2 and 3}
%DIFDELCMD < %%%
\DIFdel{Experiment 2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \subsection{Discussion of Experiments 1 and 2}
\DIFadd{Experiment 1 }\DIFaddend clearly showed that a short feedback delay of
3.5 s slowed criterial learning. In contrast, increasing the
ITI to this same value had no effect on learning. The task
we used was one-dimensional category learning, but we
isolated criterial learning by instructing participants
about the optimal strategy. Specifically, we told them which
stimulus dimension was relevant and that there was no
trial-by-trial variability on the irrelevant dimension.
Although these results strongly suggest that the feedback
delay had its interfering effects on criterial learning,
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2 }\DIFaddend was designed to confirm this inference. The
goal here was to examine the effects of the same feedback
delays and ITIs on performance in a one-dimensional
category-learning task that did not require any criterial
learning, but did require category-learning processes that
are thought to mediate rule discovery (e.g., rule selection
and switching). If the feedback delay effects observed in
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend were acting on some general category-learning
skill then we should have seen the same interfering effects
of feedback delay in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3. }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2. }\DIFaddend However, if the
feedback-delay interference of Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2 }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1 }\DIFaddend was operating
selectively on criterial learning, then it should disappear
in Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{3}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{2}\DIFaddend , since no criterial learning was required.
Our results strongly supported this latter prediction.
Therefore, Experiments 2 and 3 together strongly suggest
that criterial learning is impaired by feedback delays and
is relatively unaffected by the length of the ITI.

Two prior studies investigated similar issues. First, Ell
and colleagues reported that feedback delay and also a
concurrent memory-scanning task each impaired rule-based
category learning \parencite{ell2009critrial}. Based on
these results, they hypothesized that criterial learning may
be tied to working-memory capacity and therefore to explicit
cognitive mechanisms. However, criterial learning was
confounded with rule selection and task difficulty in their
design.  Furthermore, \textcite{ell2009critrial} found that
feedback delay only impaired learning when working memory
demand was high -- that is, when participants had to learn
more than one response criterion for optimal performance. In
contrast, we found that feedback delay impairs learning even
when working memory demands are trivial (participants never
have to keep in mind more than one criterion).

Second, \textcite{bohil2014implicit} reported that the
effects of unequal base rates on criterion placement in
rule-based category learning were diminished under delayed
feedback and also under an observational training protocol
that is also thought to selectively impair basal
ganglia-dependent associative-learning mechanisms. These
results are consistent with our findings. However, because
they were obtained by manipulating base rates, it is
difficult to conclude that the delay affected criterial
learning, \emph{per se}. For example, consider a simple
two-stage model in which the first stage learns the base
rates and the second stage uses what the first stage learned
to adjust the response criterion appropriately. The
\textcite{bohil2014implicit} results are also consistent
with the hypothesis that the feedback delay impaired the
first of these stages but not the second. Our results
strongly suggest that feedback delays impair criterial
learning (and therefore the second of these hypothetical
stages).

\section{General Discussion}
We developed \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{three }\DIFdelend novel models of criterial learning that were
designed to explore how feedback delay and ITI duration
affect criterial learning.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{Two of these models }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{One class of model }\DIFaddend assumed that
decisions are made by comparing the current percept to a
stored referent, or criterion, and that the remembered value
of this criterion is updated following error feedback via a
gradient-descent learning rule.  \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The first of these models,
the time-dependent drift model
, posits that
both the criterion and the percept drift }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{This class of model
generates sensitivity to feedback delay and ITI duration
through (1) directly assuming that the update rule is
inversely scaled by the feedback delay, (2) assuming that
the representation of the percept drifts }\DIFaddend over time, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{leading to
similar impairments when feedback is delayed or the ITI is
increased. The second model, the delay-sensitive learning
model, assumes that although neither the percept nor the
criterion drift over
time, optimal criterial learning
requires immediate feedback.  As a result, this

The experiments were designed to test these predictions. Our

sensitive to feedback delay but not to the ITI duration.

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{The time-dependent drift model was based on the idea that criterial learning might be entirely supported by working

\DIFdel{In contrast, the }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{duration, this interpretation is difficult to

\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{learning model was inspired
by the idea that a response }\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{update rule is required for this class of model. An
alternative possibility for where the }\DIFaddend criterion might be
encoded in a more stable memory system.  One appealing
candidate for this function is the cerebellum, where
synaptic plasticity has been shown to follow a gradient
descent learning rule and also to be sensitive to feedback
timing \parencite{brudner2016delayed, held_adaptation_1966,
honda_adaptation_2012, kitazawa_effects_1995,
kitazawa_prism_2002}.   Finally, the reinforcement-learning
model draws on the idea that criterial learning could emerge
through stimulus-response association learning driven by
dopamine-dependent synaptic plasticity in the striatum. This
process aligns with established theories of category
learning that posit a key role to this learning process in
the basal ganglia \cite{AshbyCOVIS1998}.

Our results do not strongly favor \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{the delay-sensitive
learning model over the reinforcement learning model or vice
versa}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{one model over another}\DIFaddend .
The critical disagreement between these accounts is whether
the criterion has any real psychological meaning. \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{In
the delay-sensitive learning model it does, and thus this
model is psychologically similar to the time-dependent drift
model -- the main disagreement being about whether the
representation of the criterion is stable and if the

\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{One class
assumes the criterion is stored in memory and compared
against incoming stimuli to generate responses.  }\DIFaddend The
reinforcement-learning model\DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{, in contrast, }\DIFaddend makes very
different psychological assumptions. This model assumes that
behaviors described as ``criterial learning'' are actually
mediated by the learning of stimulus-response associations.
According to this account, the criterion has no internal
representation and therefore no psychological meaning.
Testing between these two very different accounts of
criterial learning should be a focus of future research. 

We are not aware of any data that directly addresses the
question of whether a response criterion is a fundamental
psychological construct, \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{as the delay-sensitive learning
model suggests, }\DIFdelend or whether it is unnecessary\DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{, as assumed by
the reinforcement learning model}\DIFdelend . Even
so, there are some results in the category-learning
literature that support the interpretation of the
reinforcement-learning model. In information-integration
(II) category-learning tasks, the optimal strategy is
similarity-based, and difficult or impossible to describe
verbally \parencite[e.g.,][]{AshbyValentin2018}. When the
stimuli vary on two dimensions, the stimuli from contrasting
categories can be partitioned by a decision bound that is
conceptually similar to a response criterion. In both cases,
all stimuli on one side are associated with one response,
and all stimuli on the other side are associated with the
contrasting response. Furthermore, in agreement with
Experiment \DIFdelbegin \DIFdel{2}\DIFdelend \DIFaddbegin \DIFadd{1}\DIFaddend , II category learning is impaired by short
feedback delays \parencite{MaddoxAshbyBohil2003,
MaddoxIng2005}. The analogous question in II category
learning is whether the decision bound is learned directly
or whether it is simply the set of points that divide the
perceptual space into contrasting response regions.  In
fact, the evidence strongly supports this latter
interpretation \parencite{AshbyWaldron1999, CasaleEtAl2012}.
For example, if the decision bound is learned, then it
should be possible to apply this bound to novel stimuli.
With rule-based categories, this is easy for participants,
but with II categories there is no evidence that the
response strategy that participants learn can be generalized
to novel stimuli \parencite{CasaleEtAl2012} -- a result that
strongly supports the hypothesis that the decision bound has
no psychological meaning. 

Our results clearly demonstrate that criterial learning is
impaired by delayed feedback, and not by extending the
intertrial interval. These results are consistent with the
hypothesis that criterial learning is a form of
basal-ganglia mediated associative learning, and are
inconsistent with hypotheses that criterial learning is a
working-memory-based process. Thus, our results provide a
critical constraint on future models of rule-based
classification and decision making, and possibly also on
more general accounts of criterion setting, such as in
signal detection theory.

Previous studies have failed to find that feedback delays
impair rule-based category learning, and on the face of it,
this seems to contradict our finding that feedback delays
impair criterial learning. However, all earlier RB studies
that looked for effects of a feedback delay, either used
binary-valued stimulus dimension and so no criterial
learning was needed, or else set the response criterion
exactly midway between the category prototypes, which makes
criterial learning trivial. For example, under these
conditions, criterial learning might not even require
feedback. The unsupervised category-learning experiments
reported by \textcite{ashby1999dominance} provide strong
support for this because all of their rule-based
participants learned the correct criterion (which was midway
between the category means), even though the task was
completely unsupervised. Moreover, all previous studies
failed to isolate criterial learning, so even if there was
an effect of feedback delay on criterial learning, it could
have been masked by larger effects caused by other
rule-learning processes.

Criterial learning is among the most classic and ubiquitous
of all cognitive skills. For example, signal-detection
theory teaches that it is the central form of learning in an
enormous range of decision-making tasks -- everything from
simple YES-NO detection of a weak signal to assessing the
guilt or innocence of a defendant in a jury trial. Our
results suggest that even in simple rule-based tasks,
criterial learning seems to be subserved, at least in part,
by associative mechanisms. Most current theories tend to
classify tasks as either executive function (e.g.,
rule-based category learning) or procedural (e.g., mirror
tracing). Our results suggest that such classification
schemes might oversimplify how humans perform these tasks,
and therefore that much more work is needed to understand
how different learning and memory systems interact.
